Although Kosovo has started to digitalize public processes and to support such applications, still there is a need to advance this initiative. Until now, a system that collects the main services in one place for citizens, such as the control of various fines, internet bills and other services, as well as their payment, does not exist in our country. The development of this application which will serve as portfolio for Kosovo citizens. On the other hand, the Kosovo Police Service would have easier access to different statistics, as well as real-time access to fines that could be recorded by the police officers. The almost most important service that also addresses the current need for the possibility of digital driver's license control, would be able to be controlled by the Kosovo Police, and maintained by them for the citizens of Kosovo who are or will be in possession of a driver's license.
